## Maps

###Eol

![Eol preview](images/ElementalVector/eol.png)

An aerial map with narrow catwalks. The second floor is a strategic position you should try to control. Mastering skill jumps would be a great help in this one.

#####Interactive elements :
* Bumpers (rendered as sparks bursts) can be activated for a short time, allowing you to access the second floor of the map.

###Lava Pit

A map with a deadly lava floor. The large stone platforms aren't very safe because of their trend to sink into the lava.
Some platforms are unstable, and might flip when you jump on it, so watch your step !

#####Interactive elements :
* Lava spheres can be projected to an enemy and kill them instantly.However if your foes are fast enough, they can project the spheres again while increasing their speed each time. Be careful of the backfire !
* Activating a metalic orb makes the stone platform underneath sink. After a short duration, it will go back to its original position.
