Save the ocean by using an ancient force and by traveling through time to enable new possibilities!

### Description

The ocean was stolen by the Nemesians and locked in gigantic bubbles. 
Your objective is to free the waters and bring life back to those now arid lands by using the powers of your ancesters.
Using the help of his grand-mother from the past, the young Dæris will be able to progress through the desert and destroy the generators powering the ocean shackles.
